## [Check out the Wiki!](https://github.com/jrunzer26/MobileProjectApp/wiki)
 The wiki has information on how to play the game! Don't forget to check it out!
 
## [Webservice](https://github.com/jrunzer26/MobileProject)
 The supporting webservice can be found [here](https://github.com/jrunzer26/MobileProject).

Created with node.js express along with a postgresql database.
Hosted with DigitalOcean.
The webservice is used to strictly query the database and update the user's resources every hour.

## Special Instructions
1. Try registering an account!
2. Start initially at UOIT: Lng: -78.8964, Lat: 43.9454
3. If you don't see any lines since your location changed rapidly, press the back button and re-enter the game.
4. This is an area in the game that has multiple users and tiles that you can take over!
5. Don't update your location too far at one time. This game is meant to be played on a phone and a user cannot teleport.
6. An example of this is changing your longitude from -78.89**64** to -78.89**91**. Sometimes the provider does not notify that there is a change in location and sometimes it is not recognized. However, it works much better on an actual device.
7. Try to buy soldiers on your green tiles! It cost 10 gold per soldier and make sure only one tile is clicked.
8. Try to battle. The more soldiers you have against the other tile the more of a chance you have to beat them. It costs 10 food per soldier to battle. Select your tile and an opposing red tile, then click battle.
9. Login to this account at UOIT's location with username: **jason** password: **password** to see another user's perspective of the world.
10. Resources are gained every hour! Come back later if you have captured tiles after each hour of the day to see your resources change.
